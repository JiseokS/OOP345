I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.
*/

Through this workshop, it was helpful to understand the external and internal linkage more clearly.
External linkage can be used in other external modules, that are tax rates and special discounts.
Example)

extern double g_taxrate, g_dailydiscount;

Other modules have access to g_taxrate and g_dailydiscount via #include "foodorder.h".
However, internal linkage are declared and used within the same module.

Example)
double food_price;

I used the static to implement the "counter" variable in the display function. Static is the display Calculate how many times 
the function is called. The program allocates memory when compiling time. Static functions can be accessed by other class properties
 and functions, and static variables within the function can be accessed. However, you cannot access other ordinary attributes of the class.

There are some additions in Part 2. 
In Part 1, an array of large sizes rather than the exact size was used and converted into a pointer. 
It was possible to use an array of exact sizes without wasting memory. 
Example)
char food_description[25] -> char* food_description{};
Because we used pointer types, we used constructors, allocation copies, and destructors.
