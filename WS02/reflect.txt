I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

Through this workshop2, I can understand and use fstream, copy constructor, copy assignment, move constructor ,move assignment.
First, in "fstream" the file was read through getline and stored in a string type variable. 
In order to read the total number of lines of the file, the file location indicator was moved to start point
using the "seekg" function and the file was read again.
I could measure the time it takes to implement the function using crono.
example)
std::chrono::steady_clock::time_point start_time;
std::chrono::steady_clock::time_point end_time;

I think the core of this workshop is move construction and movement alignment.
The move() function changes the rvalue. The changed rvalue is moved by the move constructor I implemented.
The move constructor receiving the rvalue is faster than the copy constructor
Unlike copy assignment, move assignment are fast in terms of speed because they do not reallocate memory.

We used size_t to use unsigned int.
This type of object typically has pointers to dynamic memory and unsigned integers for tracking array size.
